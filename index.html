            <p class="mb-2">
              For the last 6 months I have worked as a module specialist in Kaiku.
              My main responsibilities have been to develop new programs that are
              used by cancer patients to monitor their health and wellbeing,
              and in research with pharma companies. I've learned so much about
              working in agile environment in a product house, how to be a valuable
              team member, and how to communicate with different stakeholders.
              And of course did some rigorous coding too. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              For 5 months in 2023 I honed my full-stack coding skills
              in Integrify Academy. During this program I had the opportunity to
              work on some exciting projects and enhance my skills, such as
              front-end development using React, Redux, TypeScript, and Material
              UI, learning the backend with C# and ASP.NET and EF Core
              framework, using PostgreSQL database and Azure cloud services.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              I've studied Mathematics as major in University of Helsinki with
              Computer Science as minor, so it has left me equipped with
              valuable competences, such as breaking down complex problems into
              more manageable sized puzzles, sharp analytical thinking and
              exquisite logical reasoning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also a gardener, so I value beauty and simplicity in code, and
              definitely understand the value of maintainability.

              One of my favorite pastime hobbies is tabletop role-playing. This
              project is to help manage spells while playing D&D, for both
              players and DMs. User can view selected spells in one page for
              easier management. <br />
              To do: Sign to to use same spellbook with multiple devices, and
              to have more that one book.

              I had an extra display at home, and decided to use it to display
              useful information. Right now it shows time and date, next busses
              & trams in the nearest stations, current price of electricity as
              well as electricity prices in columns. The data is fetched from
              different APIs and displayed in a simple React app.<br />
              To do: show weather forecast and train schedules of nearest
              stations.

              As I love to read, and have a large home library, this fullstack
              project made as an assignment for Integrify is meant to be a
              library management system for every home library, so the owner can
              track to whom the books have been loaned. Admin can add, edit and
              delete books, and edit and delete users. Users create accounts,
              log in and loan books.
